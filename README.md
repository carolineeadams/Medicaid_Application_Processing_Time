This repository contains all data and documents used as part of an analysis evaluating factors associated with the time it takes for state Medicaid programs to process Medicaid applications. Data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Kaiser Family Foundation, and FiveThirtyEight were used to conduct this analysis. The project was composed of two parts. First, data visualizations were created to qualitatively assess how different factors impacted the time it takes for states to process Medicaid applications. Second, a preliminary machine learning pipeline was developed to predict the time it takes for a state to process Medicaid applications and to understand which factors were most influential in making that prediction. All findings are presented in the final report PDF file.
