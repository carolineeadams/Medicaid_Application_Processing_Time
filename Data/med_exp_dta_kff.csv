"A central goal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is to significantly reduce the number of uninsured by providing a continuum of affordable coverage options through Medicaid and the Health Insurance Marketplaces. The ACA expands Medicaid coverage for most low-income adults to 138% of the federal poverty level (FPL); see this [table](http://kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/medicaid-income-eligibility-limits-for-adults-as-a-percent-of-the-federal-poverty-level-january-2015/) for state by state Medicaid income eligibility levels for adults. Following the June 2012 Supreme Court decision, states face a decision about whether to adopt the Medicaid expansion. It is important to note that per CMS guidance, there is no deadline for states to implement the Medicaid expansion."

Footnotes
"1. Coverage under the Medicaid expansion became effective January 1, 2014 in all states that have adopted the Medicaid expansion except for the following: Michigan (4/1/2014), New Hampshire (8/15/2014), Pennsylvania (1/1/2015), Indiana (2/1/2015), Alaska (9/1/2015), Montana (1/1/2016), Louisiana (7/1/2016), Virginia (1/1/2019), Maine (1/10/2019 with coverage retroactive to 7/2/2018), Idaho (1/1/2020), Utah (1/1/2020), Nebraska (10/1/2020), Oklahoma (7/1/2021), and Missouri (Processing applications beginning 10/1/2021 with coverage retroactive to 7/1/2021)."
"2. Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ohio, and Utah have approved Section 1115 waivers to operate their Medicaid expansion programs in ways not otherwise allowed under federal law. Some of these [Section 1115 waivers](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-waiver-tracker-approved-and-pending-section-1115-waivers-by-state/) include work requirements, which the Biden Administration has recently begun the process of withdrawing."
"3. In September 2021, Arkansas submitted a [Section 1115 waiver](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/medicaid-work-requirements-at-u-s-supreme-court/) to CMS that would replace the state’s current Medicaid expansion program, Arkansas Works, with the Arkansas Health and Opportunity for Me (ARHOME) program.  Unlike Arkansas Works, ARHOME does not include [work requirements](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/medicaid-work-requirements-at-u-s-supreme-court/) but would allow the state’s Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) to incentivize enrollee participation in health improvement and economic independence initiatives. ARHOME proposes to consider QHP enrollees who do not participate in these incentives as ""inactive"" and to reassign them to the state’s fee-for-service program."
"4. An initiative to put Medicaid expansion on the 2020 ballot was delayed by its organizing committee to the 2022 ballot."
"5. On October 15, 2020, CMS approved an 1115 waiver called Georgia Pathways to Coverage which extends Medicaid coverage to 100% FPL for parents and childless adults with initial and continued enrollment conditioned on compliance with work and premium requirements and other eligibility and benefit restrictions at the regular state match rate. Although coverage under this eligibility extension was set to begin on July 1st, 2021, the state announced a delay in waiver implementation until at least the end of calendar year 2021, following the Biden Administration's steps to withdraw [waivers](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-waiver-tracker-approved-and-pending-section-1115-waivers-by-state/) with work requirement provisions."
"6. Enrollment in Medicaid coverage under expansion began on November 1, 2019, and coverage for these enrollees began on January 1, 2020. Following a successful expansion ballot measure in November 2018, in 2019 Governor Brad Little signed a bill passed by the legislature that directed the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare to seek waivers for multiple changes to the expansion program and specified that if the waivers were not approved by January 1, 2020, then all individuals up to 138% FPL will be enrolled in Medicaid. The state submitted four waivers at direction from this legislation; however, only one has been approved to date."
"7. Democratic Governor Laura Kelly included Medicaid expansion in her proposed budget for State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2022; however, the Republican-controlled legislature did not include expansion in its final budget. Separately, in February 2021 Governor Kelly had proposed Medicaid expansion legislation similar to a bipartisan Medicaid expansion bill introduced in January 2020 with premiums and a work referral program, funded with revenue from medical marijuana sales and taxes rather than with a reinsurance program and hospital surcharge as proposed in the 2020 bill. On May 26, the 2021 legislative session adjourned without any additional action on Kelly’s bill."
"8. On December 16, 2019, newly elected Democratic Governor Andy Beshear signed an executive order rescinding the [Kentucky HEALTH waiver](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-waiver-tracker-approved-and-pending-section-1115-waivers-by-state/) that had been set aside by the court in March 2019.  The waiver had included a number of provisions including a work requirement, monthly premiums up to 4% of income, and coverage lockouts for failure to timely renew eligibility or timely report a change in circumstances.  Kentucky’s expansion program was originally implemented and continues to operate under state plan amendment (SPA) authority."
"9. Maine implemented expansion on January 10, 2019. Maine adopted the Medicaid expansion through a ballot initiative in November 2017. After former Governor LePage delayed implementation of the expansion for months, new Governor Mills signed an executive order on her first day in office (January 3, 2019) directing the Maine Department of Health and Human Services to begin expansion implementation and provide coverage to those eligible retroactive to July 2018. CMS approved the state's plan retroactive to July 2, 2018 on April 3, 2019."
"10. Although Mississippi’s Secretary of State approved a 2022 Medicaid expansion ballot initiative for circulation in April 2021, on May 19 the organizing committee suspended its campaign following a Mississippi Supreme Court decision ruling that the state’s entire ballot initiative process is inoperable due to procedural errors regarding ballot initiative language in the state’s constitution. While Medicaid expansion was a key issue in the 2019 Mississippi gubernatorial election, current Republican Governor Tate Reeves opposes expansion, making it unlikely that the state will take up expansion through legislation."
"11. Missouri began implementing expansion by accepting applications on August 10, 2021, though the state will not begin processing applications until October 1, 2021. Coverage will be available retroactive to July 1, 2021, consistent with a state supreme court [order]( https://www.courts.mo.gov/file.jsp?id=178955). Missouri voters approved a ballot measure on August 4, 2020, that added Medicaid expansion to the state’s constitution. After Governor Mike Parson announced that the state [would not implement expansion](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/status-of-medicaid-expansion-in-missouri-and-implications-for-coverage-and-cost/) because the ballot measure did not include a revenue source, individuals who would be eligible for expansion coverage filed a lawsuit against the state. Ultimately, the Missouri Supreme Court ruled that the initiated amendment is valid under the state constitution and that the legislature’s budget appropriation authorizes the state to fund expansion coverage."
"12. On April 18, 2019, the Montana Legislature passed a bill (which was signed by Governor Bullock on May 9, 2019) to continue the state’s expansion program with significant changes until 2025. This action came after Montana voters voted down a measure on the November 2018 ballot that would have extended the Medicaid expansion beyond the June 30, 2019 sunset date and raised taxes on tobacco products to finance the expansion. The approved bill directs the state to seek federal waiver authority to make several changes to the existing expansion program, including adding a work requirement as a condition of eligibility and increasing the premiums required of many beneficiaries. Per the legislation, the state submitted a Section 1115 waiver proposal with these changes to CMS on August 30, 2019 and the request is pending."
"13. Enrollment in Medicaid coverage under expansion in Nebraska began on August 1, 2020, and coverage for these enrollees began on October 1, 2020. Nebraska voters had approved a Medicaid expansion ballot measure in November 2018, and the state delayed implementation to allow time to seek a Section 1115 waiver to implement expansion with program elements that differ from what is allowed under federal law, including a tiered benefit structure that requires beneficiaries to meet work and healthy behavior requirements to access certain benefits. While CMS approved this [waiver](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/section-1115-demo/demonstration-and-waiver-list/82486) on October 20, 2020, on August 17, 2021, the state requested to withdraw its approved waiver, which CMS subsequently approved on September 2. The state [announced](https://dhhs.ne.gov/Pages/DHHS-Announces-Updates-to-Medicaid-Expansion.aspx) that it plans to offer all expansion adults full benefits starting October 1, 2021."
"14. On March 24, 2021, Democratic Governor Roy Cooper included Medicaid expansion in his biennial state budget proposal for State Fiscal Years (SFY) 2022-2023. The budget assumes that the estimated $1.3 billion for the state’s share of expansion would be more than offset with federal dollars under the incentive in the [American Rescue Plan](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/new-incentive-for-states-to-adopt-the-aca-medicaid-expansion-implications-for-state-spending/). In 2019, Governor Cooper vetoed the SFY 2020-2021 budget passed by the Republican-controlled legislature due to omission of Medicaid expansion, and the 2019 legislative session resulted in a budget impasse. In August 2020, Governor Cooper once again included Medicaid expansion in his proposal for coronavirus-related adjustments to the FY 2020-2021 budget, but the legislature has not included expansion in any of its coronavirus relief bills."
"15. Enrollment in Medicaid coverage under expansion in Oklahoma began on June 1, 2021, with coverage for these enrollees beginning on July 1, 2021. Oklahoma voters approved a ballot measure on June 30, 2020 which added Medicaid expansion to the state’s Constitution. Language in the approved measure prohibits the imposition of any additional burdens or restrictions on eligibility or enrollment for the expansion population."
"16. On December 12, 2019, CMS [approved](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-waiver-tracker-approved-and-pending-section-1115-waivers-by-state/) two separate 1115 waivers for South Carolina which would extend Medicaid coverage from 67% to 100% FPL for its parent/caretaker relative groups and a new targeted adult group with initial and continued enrollment conditioned on compliance with work requirements at the regular match rate. In February 2021, the Biden Administration began to withdraw [waivers](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-waiver-tracker-approved-and-pending-section-1115-waivers-by-state/) with work requirement provisions."
"17. In November 2020, South Dakota’s Secretary of State approved two 2022 Medicaid expansion ballot initiative petitions for circulation, both filed by the organizing committee Dakotans for Health. One is a constitutional amendment and the other is an initiated state statute (the constitutional amendment requires roughly double the number of signatures). Separately, the organizing committee South Dakotans Decide Healthcare filed two similar petitions for the 2022 ballot in February 2021, including an initiated constitutional amendment subsequently approved for circulation on March 25, 2021. Advocates have until November 2021 to gather signatures for constitutional amendments and until May 2022 for initiated state statutes."
"18. Medicaid coverage under expansion began on January 1, 2020. Following a successful Medicaid expansion ballot measure in November 2018, the state legislature took [steps](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/from-ballot-initiative-to-waivers-what-is-the-status-of-medicaid-expansion-in-utah/) to roll back the full expansion by directing the state to submit a series of [Section 1115 waivers](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-waiver-tracker-approved-and-pending-section-1115-waivers-by-state/). On December 23, 2019, CMS approved certain provisions in the state’s ""Fallback Plan"" waiver request to amend its Primary Care Network Waiver to expand Medicaid eligibility to 138% FPL, effective January 1, 2020; the approval also included work requirements for the newly expanded adult Medicaid population. In February 2021, the Biden Administration began to withdraw [waivers](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-waiver-tracker-approved-and-pending-section-1115-waivers-by-state/) with work requirement provisions."
"19. The Virginia General Assembly approved Medicaid expansion as part of its FY 2019-2020 budget on May 30, 2018; Governor Northam signed the budget into law on June 7, 2018. Expansion coverage became effective under state plan amendment (SPA) authority on January 1, 2019 after enrollment began on November 1, 2018."
"20. After the Wisconsin Legislature's Joint Finance Committee voted to remove Medicaid expansion funding from Democratic Governor Tony Evers' State Fiscal Years (SFY) 2022-2023 budget proposal, Governor Evers signed an executive order to hold a special session for Medicaid expansion legislation on May 25, 2021, proposing to use the additional federal funds the state could receive under the incentive in the [American Rescue Plan Act](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/new-incentive-for-states-to-adopt-the-aca-medicaid-expansion-implications-for-state-spending/) for other state development projects. However, on May 25, the Republican-controlled legislature adjourned the special session without further action, and the legislature passed a SFY 2022-2023 budget without Medicaid expansion funding on June 30. The governor had included Medicaid expansion in his previous budget proposal for FY 2020-2021, but the Republican-controlled legislature did not include it in the final budget. Wisconsin covers adults up to 100% FPL in Medicaid but did not adopt the ACA expansion."
"21. A Medicaid expansion [bill](https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2021/HB0162) that passed the Wyoming House for the first time subsequently failed a vote in the Senate Labor, Health, and Social Service Committee in March 2021. However, on October 22, 2021, the legislature’s Joint Revenue Committee reintroduced this legislation ahead of an October special session—the legislation did not advance. The legislation would expand Medicaid contingent on the state continuing to receive a 90% federal match assistance percentage (FMAP) for the expansion population and at least 55% for the [traditional Medicaid population](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/federal-matching-rate-and-multiplier/?currentTimeframe=2&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22FMAP%20Percentage%22,%22sort%22:%22desc%22%7D) (a 5 percentage point increase from the traditional match rate of 50%, which is an incentive included in the [American Rescue Plan Act](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/new-incentive-for-states-to-adopt-the-aca-medicaid-expansion-implications-for-state-spending/) for adopting expansion). Prior to the new ARPA incentive, the Wyoming legislature had rejected multiple Medicaid expansion bills during the 2020 and other previous legislative sessions."
